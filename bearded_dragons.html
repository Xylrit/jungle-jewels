            Bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) are ideal animals for beginners
            in reptile care. They look jurasic, have a mellow temper, become
            used to their keeper quickly and are not difficult to keep.
          </p>

            These diurnal lizards display some nice behavior when meeting mating
            partners or rivals. Males are very aggressive towards each other and
            have to be kept alone. Females however can be kept in small groups,
            if they are of equal size and are used to company.

            Originating from dry desert and savannah areas in Australia, bearded
            dragons need high temperatures in the range of 25-35℃. They love to
            bask in direct sunlight where temperature can climb up to 50℃. Night
            time temperatures can drop to 20℃. Bearded dragons like a dry
            environment, with occasional rainfalls.

            They are not picky eaters and will consume every living insect,
            worm, maggot, etc. they can get. Once used to the keeper, they
            accept food from tweezers, which makes it possible to feed defrosted
            insects as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, they also require plant based food. Carrots, spinach,
            camote leaves, cucumber, arugula, gooliwog, any kind of vegetables,
            edible flowers etc. should be fed. Fruits should be given
            occasionally only due to the high sugar and acid content.
          </p>

          <p>
            The diet for juveniles should be 90% insects and 10% plant based. As
            they grow older, this ratio should be reversed. Adult diet should
            contain insects only once a week with vegetables as are the main
            feeds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although easy to keep, Beardies also have some requirements and will
            suffer if neglected.
